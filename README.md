## Getting Started
These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

This project is compatible with Python3

#### Install Python3
Before starting, make sure that Python3 has been correctly installed on your machine and your environment paths are configured. 

You can download Python here: 
https://www.python.org/downloads/

To set up your Path to correctly to use the python3 command, execute the following steps:
1) Run Powershell as an administrator 
2) Execute the command: 
`New-Item -ItemType SymbolicLink -Path "Link" -Target "Target"`

    where "Target" is the path to py.exe (by default this should be "C:\Windows\py.exe")\
    and "Link" is the path to py.exe, but "py.exe" is replaced with "python3.exe"\
    For Example:\
    `New-Item -ItemType SymbolicLink -Path "C:\Windows\python3.exe" -Target "C:\Windows\py.exe"`

If you are unsure, you can check by opening a command prompt window and typing the following:
`python3 --version`

If you see the version number then you have installed Python3 and set up your environment paths correctly!

----------------------------------------

#### Set up Powershell settings
If running Powershell for the first time, you will need to run this command in the Powershell console: `Set-ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned`.
The console will then prompt you with the following warning shown in the image below. 
 - Enter `'A'`. 
 	- If successful, the console will not output any messages. (You may need to run Powershell as administrator to enforce this setting).

----------------------------------------

#### Download this project
```
git clone https://github.com/MelissaData/EmailObject-Python3
cd EmailObject-Python3
```

#### Set up Melissa Updater 
Melissa Updater is a CLI application allowing the user to update their Melissa applications/data. 

- Download Melissa Updater here: <https://releases.melissadata.net/Download/Library/WINDOWS/NET/ANY/latest/MelissaUpdater.exe>
- Create a folder within the cloned repo called `MelissaUpdater`.
- Put `MelissaUpdater.exe` in `MelissaUpdater` folder you just created.

----------------------------------------

#### Different ways to get data file(s)
1.  Using Melissa Updater
    - It will handle all of the data download/path and dll(s) for you. 
2.  If you already have the latest DQS release zip, you can find the data file(s) in there
	- To pass in your own data file path directory, you may either use the '-dataPath' parameter or enter the data file path directly in interactive mode.
	- Comment out this line "DownloadDataFiles -license $License" in the powershell script.
	- This will prevent you from having to redownload all the files.

## Run Powershell Script
Parameters:
- -email: a test email address
 	
  This is convenient when you want to get results for a specific email address in one run instead of testing multiple email addresses in interactive mode.  

- -dataPath (optional): a data file path directory to test the Email Object
- -license (optional): a license string to test the Email Object
- -quiet (optional): add to the command if you do not want to get any console output from the Melissa Updater

When you have modified the script to match your data location, let's run the script. There are two modes:
- Interactive 

    The script will prompt the user for an email address, then use the provided email to test Email Object. For example:
    ```
    .\MelissaEmailObjectWindowsPython3.ps1
    ```
    For quiet mode:
    ```
    .\MelissaEmailObjectWindowsPython3.ps1 -quiet
    ```
- Command Line 

    You can pass an email in ```-email``` parameter and a license string in ```-license``` parameter to test Email Object. For example:
    ```
    .\MelissaEmailObjectWindowsPython3.ps1 -email "info@melissa.com" 
    .\MelissaEmailObjectWindowsPython3.ps1 -email "info@melissa.com" -license "<your_license_string>"
    ```
    For quiet mode:
    ```
    .\MelissaEmailObjectWindowsPython3.ps1 -email "info@melissa.com" -quiet
    .\MelissaEmailObjectWindowsPython3.ps1 -email "info@melissa.com" -license "<your_license_string>" -quiet
    ```
This is the expected output from a successful setup for interactive mode:
